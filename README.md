README â€” spaCy NVIDIA Test Notebook


This notebook demonstrates how to test spaCy comprehensively:


1. **Tokenization, POS, Dependency, and NER** tested on real NVIDIA product data.
2. **Transformer vs vector models** compared side-by-side.
3. **EntityRuler** shows domain-specific rule enhancement.
4. **Vector similarity** evaluates semantic proximity to hardware terms.
5. **Performance metrics** benchmark model latency.


### Extension ideas
- Add similarity clustering (using cosine distances)
- Integrate SentenceTransformers for richer semantic embeddings
- Train custom NER with NVIDIA-specific dataset
- Cache model inference for larger datasets


Use this as a baseline to evaluate new spaCy releases or GPU-optimized pipelines.
